# PLAN — the forced counterfactual at geometric forks (fifteenth pass), 2026-09-10 00:35 IST

## 0. Why, in three sentences

The coverage reads of 2026-09-09 (`PLAN-exit-priced-at-cap.md` §8, 17:10Z and
19:00Z) put the detour in the warm start's sample set at 0.023 (nav48, seed-0
stream), 0.016 (seed-1 stream) and about 0.06 (the uniform-label navigator):
a policy that finds a mine-free solution once in two to five thousand
episodes cannot put one into a group of six, so no on-policy recipe on this
navigator is a test of the price (D-21). The price can only act on a
comparison that contains a detour. This pass makes that comparison by
construction: at a fork the policy itself walked through, every valid move
is taken once and the policy continues from each; the fork decision is then
credited with the difference of what followed.

## 1. The construction test, which this design must pass

The organism's only source of mine information is the priced return. The
build may use (a) maze geometry — walls, the branch points of the open
cells, distances to the goal; (b) the policy's own rollouts; (c) the priced
return. It may NOT use mine positions to choose where to branch, which move
to force, which episodes to keep, or what to compare. A test asserts it (§5).

## 2. The procedure, per training step (cell A, the priced return)

1. **Sample as now.** G episodes per maze from the current policy, the
   closed action space, the exit priced at cap, the move-mass regulariser —
   nothing in the existing sampling changes.
2. **Pick one fork per sampled episode, by geometry.** A fork is a cell on
   the episode's own path at which at least two moves are valid (not a wall,
   not off-grid) other than the move that would return to the previous
   cell; when the path has no fork, the episode contributes no fork term.
   The fork is drawn uniformly at random among the episode's forks with the
   run's own generator. Mine positions are never read here.
3. **Force each valid move once, then continue on-policy.** For every valid
   move `a` at the fork (the move the episode actually took included), one
   continuation: the first move is `a`, taken by the environment; every
   later decision is sampled from the policy under the same prompt
   rendering, cap and exit rules as a normal episode, with the step budget
   equal to the cap minus the steps already taken to reach the fork. If the
   prompt carries the episode's history, the continuation carries the
   prefix's history plus `a`.
4. **Price the continuations.** Each continuation's return-to-go from the
   fork is `episode_return` on its own landings and steps (mine_cost=True,
   its remaining cap, solved or not) — the same pricing as any episode.
5. **Credit the fork.** For each valid move `a`, `A(a) = R(a) − mean_a' R(a')`
   over the fork's continuations (the difference reward; with `MZ01_FORK_STD=1`
   divided by the continuations' return SD when there are three or more).
   The fork's loss term is `−Σ_a A(a) · log π(a | fork prompt)` — a
   policy-gradient step on the fork decision alone, off-policy at that one
   token by construction, scaled by `MZ01_FORK_COEF` (default 1.0).
6. **Keep the existing update.** The sampled episodes' own per-decision
   update (episode credit, the group baseline, the regulariser) runs
   unchanged; the fork term is added to the loss. The continuations'
   decisions are NOT trained (they are the value estimate, not data), in
   this first build.

## 3. Switches

| env | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MZ01_FORK_CF` | off | `1` turns the fork term on (the arm `fork_cf_g6` in the trial registry sets it) |
| `MZ01_FORK_PER_EP` | 1 | forks branched per sampled episode |
| `MZ01_FORK_COEF` | 1.0 | weight of the fork term in the loss |
| `MZ01_FORK_STD` | 0 | `1` divides the fork advantages by the continuations' return SD |
| `MZ01_FORK_TEMP` | 1.0 | sampler temperature for the continuations only |

## 4. What the trace records, per step

`n_forks`, `n_continuations`, `fork_adv_abs_mean`, `fork_share_nonzero`
(forks whose continuations' returns differ), `fork_share_detour_better`
(forks at which the best continuation stepped on fewer mines than the move
the episode took — a diagnostic read AFTER the fact from the continuations'
landings, never used in the update), and the continuations' sampling
seconds. The reads, verdicts and bars are the trial's, unchanged.

## 5. Tests the build must ship

1. On a hand-built maze with one fork where one move steps onto a mine and
   the other detours at cost 2, with a deterministic stub policy: the two
   continuations' returns differ by the price margin (10 − 2·2 = 6) and
   `A(detour) > 0 > A(mine)`.
2. Fork selection never reads mine positions: with `maze.is_mine` (and any
   mine accessor the builder finds) monkeypatched to raise, fork selection
   and continuation launching still run; only the pricing raises.
3. The continuation's step budget is the cap minus the prefix's steps, and
   a continuation that hits it is priced as an unsolved episode at the cap.
4. With `MZ01_FORK_CF` off, the loss and the trace are byte-identical to the
   current trainer's on a fixed seed (the existing tests still pass).

## 6. Cost and the first run

Per step: G episodes plus, per episode, one fork × (2–3 valid moves)
continuations of roughly half an episode each — about 2–2.5× the sampling
of the on-policy step. First run: **the trial, cell A, seed 0, on the 4B
navigator and its warm start (`nav_nav48_4b`, `orgb_4b/warm_start.pt`), the
arm `fork_cf_g6` with the on-policy arm's other settings (mask on, exit
priced, mass 0.1, episode credit), 160 steps, reads at 40/80/120/160 on the
128 held-out mazes**, on a freed box, monitored. Verdict rules unchanged.
The control is the 4B on-policy arm at seed 0, run beside it if a box is
free (its coverage predicts DEAD).

**Reading rule, fixed now.** AVOIDS at any valid read with the 4B on-policy
control not AVOIDS is the Phase 1 signal and sends the recipe to seeds 1–3
at 4B, four per box. A fork-advantage share above 0.5 (most forks
comparing unequal continuations) with no AVOIDS says the comparison exists
and the price does not move the policy — the dose (−30) is the next arm.
A fork-advantage share below 0.1 says the forks the geometry picks are not
where the mines are, and fork selection moves to "every fork on the path"
before anything else changes.

## 7. Build rules

Isolated worktree; a critic reads the diff against §1–§5 before any launch;
no change to the reads, the verdict rules or the existing arms' behaviour;
every new flag documented in the trial's docstring and `docs/CONSTRUCTION.md`
§5.8 (which currently marks this design "not implemented").
